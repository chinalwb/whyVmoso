The reasons for why you'll prefer Vmoso to WeChat like apps for work communications

I have been using both WeChat and Vmoso for communicating with my workmates and I found I prefer Vmoso. Introduce it to you:

1. When working with others in company, they @me on WeChat, I have to scroll up one by one, to see who mentioned me; it is possible I was mentioned by multiple people, I cannot see each of them easily
2. When working with others in company, same guys can only have one chat channel, other than each channel for each topic
3. It is almost impossible to setup a channel for recording TODO items on WeChat, however, sometimes people like me used to write down what I need to do and what I want others to do and expect a clear list to see status for each of them
4. For the same file, you need to forward it multiple times to different chats if you want others see them, there is no such a space where I put them into, others can see; and if the file is updated with a new version, you need to loop the related chats to let them know the file is updated, and others need to download again to see the latest file, so much trivial work; think of you're the PM, can you imagine how crasy you'll be if you update the spec tens of times for your project or even just a feature
5. You cannot keep the communication history when you get a new phone; and I believe you have experienced this case: "Image Expired", you cannot view the image if you didn't open it during some specific time phrase.
6. I could list more, but I believe you'll enjoy using Vmoso for work and project management, only if you pay some time to play it

How I do with Vmoso for above cases:
1. Use `@Mention` filter in chat comments
2. Create another chat with them and set name you perfer
3. Use `Task`, participant is able to change the status, like in-progress or completed
4. Use `&file` and put the file to `Space`, members can see all historical versions
5. Vmoso perservers all for you
6. You can register and ask your colleagues starting work with you on Vmoso


About me: I worked for Vmoso Android app during 2013~2019. Really enjoyed and hope the next company I participant in will take Vmoso for their works.

Vmoso: Unified enterprise communication, collaboration, and engagement for better knowledge management
